    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>I am Ritika Rajput, a girl with myriad of interests. Where on one side you'll fine me involved in coding during the morning hours, on the other side you will find me dancing my heart out or playing tabla or badminton in the subsequent hours of the day.
<br>
        I am a very happy go lucky person and I believe in quote by cowlin powell that a dream doesn't becomes a reality through magic , it takes sweat determination and hardwork.
       <br> Happy coding y'all:-)</p>
